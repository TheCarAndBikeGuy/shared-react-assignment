# shared-react-assignment / Learning React Bootstrap 

Deployed On Vercel - https://shared-react-assignment.vercel.app/

This was week 10s assignment where we had to research and learn something completely new, as a pair we looked into React Bootstrap and wanted to understand how the different versions of UI work. It was very fun learning something new and being left to learn it as a pair.
